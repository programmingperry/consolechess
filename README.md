# Console Chess - The Ultimate Chaos in ASCII

Welcome to Console Chess, the one true chess game that doesn’t need a GUI because… well, we just couldn’t be bothered.  
Here, you move pieces like a real hacker: by typing on the keyboard, with maximum typing precision and a generous amount of frustration.

## Features (that might be completed someday)
- **ASCII chessboard** – Black and white, but without any fancy graphics. Retro style, baby!  
- **Manual move input** – Because using a mouse would be way too easy.  
- **Pieces move... maybe** – If you understand the code, you can prove it.  
- **No AI** – Why play against the computer when you can confuse a friend instead?  
- **Rules?** – They must be somewhere around here. Hopefully.

## Installation
1. Install Python. (If you haven’t already, what have you been doing up until now?!)
2. Clone or download this masterpiece to your device.
3. Start the game with: main.py file
   
## How to Play
1. Start the game.
2. Look at the chessboard and pretend you understand it.
3. Make an input like e2e4 (or just guess what works).
4. If the move doesn’t work, curse and search through Stack Overflow or give up.

### Note: 
This is a work in progress and by no means finished. There’s still a lot to be done.
